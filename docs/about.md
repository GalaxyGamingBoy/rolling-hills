# What is The Republic of Rolling Hill?

Welcome to the Republic of Rolling Hills, a bustling city-state located in the heart of the HackClub Minecraft server. Our city is home to a diverse group of citizens who have come together to create a unique community in this virtual world.

Our form of government is a Split Oligarchy, meaning that power is shared between two groups of leaders. This ensures that decisions are made with the input of multiple perspectives and prevents any one group from having too much control.

The Republic of Rolling Hills is not just a Minecraft project - it's a community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about creating and building together. Whether you're a seasoned Minecraft player or just starting out, there's a place for you in our city.

We believe in fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone is free to express themselves and contribute to our shared vision. From towering skyscrapers to peaceful parks, there's always something new to discover and explore in the Republic of Rolling Hills.

Join us today and become a part of this exciting project!
